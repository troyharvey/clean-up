##Details
CleanUp is a mobile application concept developed for the Louisville Code Across America Hack-a-thon on March 23, 2013.
The app gives citizens a way to organize volunteer clean-ups and report littered, vandalized or polluted areas using
their mobile phones. It makes use of Facebook events to spread volunteer events socially, and encourages participation
through game mechanics (points, levels, badges).

Public datasets to be used by th app include neighbhorhood, park, and municipality boundary data, which is used for 
awarding badges and achievements based on location. The app also creates a new dataset of littered areas in the city, 
by allowing users to photograph and report littered areas from their mobile phone.

So far this code is for a clickable prototype of an application concept. Work is also underway on a real application
that's fully integrated with Facebook. Stay tuned.
